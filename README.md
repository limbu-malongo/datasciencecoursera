The file CodeBook.md information about the work perfomed to create the script run_analysis.R, the variables in the data, and data produced with the script.

The script was prepared using the R Software Version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10)
The script was tested successful on R Software Version 3.1.0 on Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1 and Windows 8 and Windows 8.1

Assumptions:

The machine which is used to run the script has been installed with R software
The person running the script run_analysis.R knows the basics of running R scripts
The person who want to use this script knows how to download data given the url
The person using this script knows how to traverse from one folder to another

Procedure:

1. If you have not downloaded the project data, down it from the following url:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. To use this script you can decide to extract the data project or use it as it is in the zip file. The most important note is that do not change 
the name of the original zip file or the extracted data folder.

3. Make sure either the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" or the file "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip"  or both are  present in the working 
directory of R.

4. To know location of the working directory of R issue the command:
getwd()
